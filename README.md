## DSAA5009: Offline Reinforcement Learining project.

In this project, you need to train an agent to learn to do continuous control using 
[D4RL](https://github.com/digital-brain-sh/d4rl) dataset. You are required to choose 
[hopper-medium-v2](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl/wiki/Tasks) dataset 
from the [hopper](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/mujoco/hopper/) environment.

You can prepare the D4RL datasets by
```
git clone https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl.git
cd d4rl
pip install -e .
```
If there are any missing packages, you can check ```requirements.txt``` or 
simply run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can refer to [tutorial.ipynb](tutorial.ipynb) for a detailed illustration and code demo.
